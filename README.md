# PureScript `react-basic` User Details

A KSF Frontend User Details Management in [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) using the [`react-basic`](https://github.com/joelmccracken/purescript-react-basic) library.

You can see this deployed [here at `purescript-ksf-code.netlify.com`](https://purescript-ksf-code.netlify.com/)

## Development

```bash
## Install npm dependencies, PureScript compiler, etc
yarn install

## Build the PureScript project
yarn build

## Start the dev server with hot reload and stuff
## (that is, if you use `purs ide` that recompiles your stuff on save)
## Note that hot-reload won't work if you change any FFI file,
## so you'll have to `yarn build` again
yarn start
```
